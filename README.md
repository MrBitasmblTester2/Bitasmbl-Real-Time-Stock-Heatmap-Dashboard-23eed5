## Description
Build an interactive dashboard that visualizes live stock market performance using a color-coded heatmap. Users can filter sectors, view market movements, and monitor real-time changes as data updates dynamically.

## Tech Stack
- Objective-C
- GraphQL
- SignalR

## Requirements
- Handle API rate limits, errors, or missing data gracefully
- Display trend changes with smooth, real-time UI updates
- Allow users to filter stocks by category, sector, or custom criteria
- Render an interactive heatmap representing stock performance
- Fetch real-time and periodically updated stock market data

## Installation
- git clone https://github.com/MrBitasmblTester2/Bitasmbl-Real-Time-Stock-Heatmap-Dashboard-23eed5.git
- Install Objective-C dependencies as required by your environment

## Usage
- Build and run the Objective-C application

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up Objective-C project structure for the dashboard UI.
2. Configure GraphQL client to fetch stock data.
3. Integrate SignalR client for real-time updates.
4. Implement heatmap UI rendering for stock performance.
5. Add filtering controls for category, sector, and custom criteria.
6. Handle API rate limits, errors, and missing data in data layer.
7. Wire real-time updates to smooth heatmap and trend animations.
8. Schedule periodic data refresh alongside real-time updates.
